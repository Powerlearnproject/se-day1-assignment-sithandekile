Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is all about giving instuctions to the computer,solving real-world problems using technology.
It is important as one can be able to build systems and apps to make life easier for the users.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Early foundation which were first built computers in 1940 until 1960 followed by Standardizatio and Modern Software engineering 
which came in 1970-1990 where the term software engineering was born to improve software development practices,lastly Modern Advancement
which came in the year 2000 until today which come with dynamic websites,mobile first and many more.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning which involves product developers to do all necessary researches and analysis for best product.
Defining which involves the problem that needs to be solved and the solution to the problem.
Desining which involves designers to come up with a user interface template.
Developing which envolve the developers to code the template and bring it to life.
Testing which involves the testers to test what has been developed for smoother workflow without any bugs.
Finally whatever has been succeccfully developed is deployed online for the users to access it.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Watefall method involve the step by step method meaning that phase one should be concluded before jumping to the next phase
while the agile method is a collection of best practices for collaboration,making software development dynamic

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developers design,code,test and maintain applications and systems.
Quality Assuarance Engineers ensures that the software application meets quality standard by identifying bug,optimization and readability before it's release.
 Project managers they make sure that the project is finished on time and on budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intedgrated development environment is important for writting code,editing,debug,compiling and testing code. Examples  are the visual studio code, pycham,idle and sublime text
version contol system is important for developers as it keeps track of code, also helps deve;opers to collaborate with other teams smoothly. Example is the Git and Bitbucket

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
technology is a revolving field technology or languages that are working today might not be working tomorow or coming years,
I believe the best solution to this is for software engineers to keep upgrading themselves by constanly learning new technologies

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is the clear,specific, and concise instruction or data given to the model and is important as it helps to solve world's problems efficiently

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt:help to write logic.
improved:help me to write programming logic,with this prompt i believe is more efficienct as it specific on what I needed the AI to help me with
